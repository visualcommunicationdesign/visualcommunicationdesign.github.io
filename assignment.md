# Assignment

<!--
### Resources
You can use the reader (VCD) and our lectures as resource material. We will explain all the basics of perception and design. If you need more resources I recommend Visual Thinking for Design (perception & design) and Ways of Seeing (meaning).  
-->

The assignment consists of three parts, in the first you will apply your theoretical understanding to the **analysis** of images (works of art), in the second you will perform empirical **evaluations** and in the third part you will **create** code based visual based on the previous parts. Before starting the assignment, you will choose 6 images from our [selection](#selection). We carefully curated a set of interesting works that fit the course' context well. You will start with 6 images in the first part part 1, 2 for second part and 1 for the last part:

## General assesment criteria
We will use the CoNTRoL assesment criteria also used in C&C: Clear, New, True, Relevant and Like. In each part we use a selection of these criteria, specified below. 


## Part 1

### Introduction
In this first part, you will analyse 6 images on the basis of theory we discussed in class. 

### Learning outcomes
You will become critically aware of the visual world around you. You will be able to name and explain technical elements of visual communication design. You will know how these technical elements relate to the human visual system (eyes and brain) and therefore predict what information is communicated. Lastly, you will gain understanding about the role of visual communication in historical and contemporary society.  

### Instructions
Gombrich (1972) distinguishes between the *expressive*, *arousing* and *descriptive* function of images. Furthermore, during the lectures and in the book we discussed the *perceptual*, *technical* and *contextual* ingredients of visual communication:
* Expressive: What was the intention of the artist/designer? 
* Arousing: Who is it made for and how is it received? 
* Descriptive: What information is transmitted? 
* Perceptual: What ingredients, such as color, texture and space are used?
* Technical: What media are used, how is it made?
* Contextual: What is the historical, social (economical) and cultural context?

**First** you will analyse these elements individually for the images you choose. 
**Second**, you will synthesize the analysis by discussing connections between any of the 6 elements. You are free in choosing which combinations, but try to use different ones for each image. 

You are free to choose 6 images from the selection we made for you. We suggest to base your selection on:
* your personal interest
* affords different types of analysis
* seem potentially interesting for Part 2 (empirically evaluation)

### Deliverables
You can use one A4 for each image with a maximum of 250 words. Illustrations may support your argumentation. The 6 A4 pages should be bundled in 1 pdf file. Please make sure that this file does not exceed 20Mb. You can use ‘reduced filesize’ options in Adobe, for example. The purpose here is twofold: 1) my hard disk is limited and 2) some of you need to gain awareness of file size management, it will look unprofessional if you would send out a 200Mb portfolio, for example. 

### Assessment criteria
For Part 1 we will use the following criteria:
* Relevant: does the analysis apply to the image? 
* Clear: is the analysis presented in an understandable way?
* New: did you create novel insights (from the synthesis).

### Dates
- Draft: 20-mar-2020
- Video feedback: 23-mar-2020
- Final: 30-mar-2020

## Part 2

### Learning outcomes
After this part, you will be able to prepare, conduct and interpret empirical research related to visual communication. You will become familiar with standard paradigms such as visual search, change blindness, eye & mouse tracking, conspicuity, etc. You will know the strength but also weaknesses of empirical research and able to assess empirical results critically. 

### Instructions
Choose 2 images from the 6 you used in part 1. Formulate hypotheses for which you need empirical insight and explain the connection between hypothesis and paradigm (= the type of experiment). Use 2 different paradigms in each image, so you can also reflect on different types of information you can extract. 

### Deliverables
A 4 page pdf (2 pages per image) that includes the following (brief) sections:
- Image name
- Question (either a hypothesis or explorative question)
- Experimental paradigm
- Method (how many observers, what procedure etc)
- Result (some text and graphs)
- Discussion (interpretation of results)

### Assessment criteria
For Part 2 we will use the following criteria:
* Relevant: is the hypothesis meaningful? 
* Clear: are the results clearly visualised?
* True: is the interpretation of results critical? 

### Dates
- Draft: 27-mar-2020
- Video feedback: 30-mar-2020
- Final: 6-apr-2020

## Part 3

### Learning outcomes
In the last part you will learn how to use code for visual sketching. We will use P5, a javascript version of Processing that is often used by artists and designers. You will learn how to create a code based image, what interactions are possible and how libraries work. 

### Instructions
Based on part 1 and 2, you now select one image that you will use as a starting point for your sketch. 

### Deliverables
A 1 page pdf that contains a reflectons about how 

### Assessment criteria
For Part 3 we will use the following criteria:
* Relevant: is the hypothesis meaningful? 
* Clear: are the results clearly visualised?
* Like: is the interpretation of results critical? 

### Dates
- Draft: 3-apr-2020
- Video feedback: 6-apr-2020
- Final: 13-apr-2020

<!--
The assignment consists of 3 parts: analysis, evaluation and creation. You can read everything in the pdf link below. Furthermore, you need to choose 10 works from a total of 30, from every column you need to choose 1. 
* [Assignment](content/assignment_final_improved_for_clarity.pdf)
* [Source material](content/SourceMaterial.zip) where you find a pdf with all images, a table with names and the images themselves.
