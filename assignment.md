# Assignment

<!--
### Resources
You can use the reader (VCD) and our lectures as resource material. We will explain all the basics of perception and design. If you need more resources I recommend Visual Thinking for Design (perception & design) and Ways of Seeing (meaning).  
-->

This assignment will introduce you to various aspects of visual communication design. In the first part you will learn about visual communication by analysing pictures *theoretically*, i.e. based on what you know from reading materials, lectures and own insights/reasoning. In the second part you will use an *empirical* approach and conduct experiments. The last part requires a *creative* approach, where you will design your own form of visual communication.

<!--Before starting the assignment, you will choose 6 images from our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/selection2021">selection</a>. We carefully curated a set of interesting works that fit the course' context well. You will start with 6 images in the first part part 1, 2 for second part and 1 for the last part:

## General assessment criteria
We will use the CoNTRoL assessment criteria also used in [Context and Conceptualisation](https://studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=36962): Clear, New, True, Relevant and Like. In each part we use a selection of these criteria, specified below.

## Part 1 - Analyze

### Introduction


<!--You can analyse a picture in a million different ways, so we need some kind of framework. We believe the Jakobson model is well suited to address  important elements of visual communication. This model consists of 6 elements that serve as a framework to start your thinking about visual communication.




* **Sender** Who is the sender? Is the sender also the creator? What is the intention behind the message?
* **Receiver** Who will be reached by the message? How is the message interpreted? How does the message affect the receivers' state of mind?
* **Context** What is the historical and social context? But also: what is the physical context, a museum, on the street, in a cave. And a bit meta: what is the form-context?
* **Contact** What physical medium is used? Is it real or a facsimile? What network established contact between the sender and receiver?
* **Code** What visual style is used to convey the message? What are the building blocks of the image? What are the conventions used?
* **Message** What can be seen in the image, what objects, persons, relations, narratives are present?

When doing the analysis, don't worry about...

* to which elements something belongs. It is either of interest (to you) or it's not, but it does not matter whether it belongs to 'code' or 'message'.
* following the list like a questionnaire. You can do it as a start, but then start connecting dots & removing irrelevant info.

but do worry about...

* follow up your observation with questions and reasoning, generalize, discuss implications etc. For example, when you find that the work was not made/produced by the artist: how would that affect your own appreciation, and that of the public? And are there other examples of outsourcing production? Is it happening today? In which areas? Would it be allowed to let another student 'produce' your assignment like an artwork, or is that fraud?
* enjoy developing original thoughts. Off course you can search for info but let that be a start, not the finish. Don't worry whether your original thoughts are maybe already known somewhere. It is really about the process that you can experience creating insights.

<!--Gombrich (1972) distinguishes between the *expressive*, *arousing* and *descriptive* function of images. In ‘A Primer of Visual Literacy’ (1973) Donis A. Dondis breaks down the expression and reception of visual messages on three levels of information retrieval: representation, abstraction and symbolism. All of  these levels “are interconnected and overlapping, but can be sufficiently distinguished from each other so that they can be analysed both as to their value as potential tactics for message-making and their quality in the process of seeing.” Furthermore, during the lectures and in the book we discussed the perceptual (what?), technical (how?) and contextual ingredients (when, where and why?) of visual communication. Taken together, we have a list of visual communication elements:

* Expressive: What was the intention of the artist/designer?
* Arousing: Who is it made for and how is it received?
* Descriptive: What information is transmitted?
* Representationally: What can be seen and recognised?
* Abstractly: Which more direct, emotional, and primitive message-making means are used?
* Symbolically: Which coded symbol system can be deciphered?
* Perceptual: What ingredients, such as color, texture and space are used?
* Technical: What media are used, how is it made?
* Contextual: What is the historical, social (economical) and cultural context?

Take notice that this list is *interconnected, overlapping and incomplete*. UPDATE, we made a [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DXR6YJvkKFGXYpCBWHJ_l7DvIVPb6xvPAWK_nSsrElE/edit?usp=sharing) where we changed the order of the elements a bit, and gave some example questions that could be answered.
-->


### Learning outcomes
You will become critically aware of the visual world around you. You will be able to name and explain technical elements of images. You will know how these technical elements relate to the human visual system (eyes and brain) and therefore predict what information is communicated. Lastly, you will gain understanding about the role of visual communication in historical and contemporary society.  

### Instructions

Select 4 images from our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/selection2021">selection</a> and base your analysis on the Jakobson model. Importantly, look for connections between the elements, for example between form and content.


<!--
**First** you will analyse these elements individually. You do not have to discuss all 9 elements for each image, only when they are relevant. But try to at least discuss each element at least once.

**Second**, you will synthesize the analysis by discussing connections between any of the elements. You are free in choosing which combinations.
-->
<!--You are free to choose 6 images from the selection we made for you. We suggest to base your selection on:
* your personal interest
* affords different types of analysis
* seem potentially interesting for Part 2 (empirically evaluation)-->


<!--### Deliverables
Use one A4 for each image with a maximum of 250 words. Illustrations can support your argumentation. The A4 pages should be bundled in 1 pdf file. Please make sure that this file does not exceed 20Mb. You can use ‘reduced filesize’ options in Adobe, for example. <!--The purpose here is twofold: 1) my hard disk is limited and 2) some of you need to gain awareness of file size management 🤔, it will look unprofessional if you would send out a 200Mb portfolio, for example. -->
-->


### Assessment criteria
For Part 1 we will use the following criteria:
* True: does the analysis apply to the image?
* Clear: is the analysis presented in an understandable way?
* New: did you create novel insights.

## Part 2 - Evaluate

### Learning outcomes
After this part, you will be able to prepare, conduct and interpret empirical research related to visual communication. You will become familiar with standard paradigms such as visual search, change blindness, eye & mouse tracking, conspicuity, etc. You will know the strength but also weaknesses of empirical research and able to assess empirical results critically.

### Instructions
Formulate hypotheses for which you need empirical insight and explain the connection between hypothesis and paradigm (= the type of experiment). Use 2 different paradigms per image, so you can also reflect on different types of information you can extract. Go to the (<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/paradigms">experimental paradigms</a>) page for more info, but be warned: you do not _have_ to use these, feel free to come up with your own ways of evaluating.



### Assessment criteria
For Part 2 we will use the following criteria:
* Relevant: is the hypothesis meaningful?
* Clear: are the results clearly presented?
* True: is the interpretation of results critical?

## Part 3 - Create

### Learning outcomes
In the last part you will learn how to use code for visual sketching. We will use [P5js.org](https://P5js.org), a javascript version of Processing that is used by many artists and designers. You will learn how to create a code based image, what interactions are possible and how (machine learning) libraries work.

### Instructions
You now select one image that you will use as a starting point for your P5 sketch. In this sketch, you are relatively free to communicate an insight about the work of art you choose for this last part of the assignment. This can be (partly) based on the insights you explicitly gained in the analysis (I) and/or evaluation (II) part, but it can also be something else you discovered.  

### Assessment criteria
For Part 3 we will use the following criteria:
* New: combines or creates something new
* Relevant: reflection
* Like: 🙂
