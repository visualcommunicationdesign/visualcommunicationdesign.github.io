# General

### Resources
You can use the reader (VCD) and our lectures as resource material. We will explain all the basics of perception and design. If you need more resources I recommend Visual Thinking for Design (perception & design) and Ways of Seeing (meaning).  


## Part 1

### Introduction
In this first part, you will do curating and research, which will allow you to demonstrate your theoretical knowledge. In the second part, you will perform empirical research where you learn how to generate new insights when theory does not suffice. In the third part you will learn to program a website (element) that communicates your findings in relation to the (virtual) museum show.
### Learning outcomes
You will be able to interpret visual designs in the context of maker and sender. You will be able to name and explain technical elements of visual communication design (e.g. generative textures, motion parallax, colour analysis, etc). You will know how these technical elements relate to the human visual system (eyes and brain) and therefore predict what information is communicated. Lastly, you will gain understanding about the role of visual communication in historical and contemporary society, and learn about considerations and motivations of visual communication designers.  
### Instructions
Gombrich (1972) distinguishes between the *expressive*, *arousing* and *descriptive* function of images. Furthermore, during the lectures and in the book we discussed the *perceptual*, *technical* and *contextual* ingredients of visual communication:
* Expressive: What was the intention of the artist/designer? 
* Arousing: Who is the target audience and how did/do they react? 
* Descriptive: What information is transmitted? 
* Perceptual: What ingredients, such as color, texture and space are used?
* Technical: What media are used, what is the ‘form’ of the design?
* Contextual: What is the historical, social and cultural context?

**First** you will start with addressing these elements individually for the image set you choose. 
**Second**, synthesize your analysis by discussing connections between any of the 6 elements. You are free in choosing which combinations, but try to use different ones for each image. 
You are free to choose 6 images from the selection we made for you. We suggest to base your selection on:
* your personal interest
* affords different types of analysis
* seem potentially interesting for Part 2 (empirically evaluation)

### Deliverables
You can use one A4 for each image with a maximum of 250 words. Illustrations may support your argumentation. The 6 A4 pages should be bundled in 1 pdf file. Please make sure that this file does not exceed 20Mb. You can use ‘reduced filesize’ options in Adobe, for example. The purpose here is twofold: 1) my harddisk is limited and 2) some of you need to gain awareness of file size management, it will look unprofessional if you would send out a 200Mb portfolio, for example. 

### Assessment criteria
For Part 1 we will use the following criteria:
* True: does the analysis of the 6 elements apply to the image? 
* Clear: is the analysis presented in an understandable way?
* New: did you create novel insights (from the synthesis).



## Part 2





The assignment consists of 3 parts: analysis, evaluation and creation. You can read everything in the pdf link below. Furthermore, you need to choose 10 works from a total of 30, from every column you need to choose 1. 
* [Assignment](content/assignment_final_improved_for_clarity.pdf)
* [Source material](content/SourceMaterial.zip) where you find a pdf with all images, a table with names and the images themselves.
