# Paradigms
Here is a set of rudimentary P5 sketches that can help you set up a visual experiment. Please check either check [Vision and Depiction (Draft)](https://homepage.tudelft.nl/w3s80/VisionAndDepiction.html#pf63) or search for the paradigm names if you want more info. Oh yes, and something else: you don't _have_ to use these. It is also fine to perform experiments using powerpoint, make a GIF, etc. Or use a questionaire on Google Forms, Qualtrix etc. There are many ways to investigate what people see.
