# Graduation projects

We have a number of graduation projects, which will be taken off line when we found a student who'll work on this. 

##1 Design for Discovery
People are often puzzled when looking at art. What should they see? What did the artist mean? What makes this work so briljant? The supplemental information provided by the museum helps somewhat, but at the same time it does not add much to the experience. 

A positive aspect of the impenetrability of art, is that there is much to discover. And discovery is off course a major motivational driver. In this project we will investigate how to design for discovery. We probably will use the synoptic viewing as a starting point from which we iterate further. 

##2 Sketching with AI
A sketch not only communicates an idea to stakeholders, but also yourself. It materialises your thought leading to a new thought. Iterations between mind and paper are an essential ingredient for many design processes. 

In this project, we will investigate how AI can facilitate this process. We will be exploring many machine learning tools such as auto-encoders, GANs, tSNEs, etc. Perhaps we can train a network ourselves, or we use pre-trained networks. In any case, we will have a lot of interesting directions to explore.

##3 Photogrammetry and online shopping
Online product communication often focuses on the use of standard photoâ€™s and in some cases videos. We have previously explored interactive ways of visualising products online, which were already pretty amazing but many more explorations are possible. 

In this project, we will investigate the use of photogrammetry for the visual communication of material and shape properties. We ask for both technical abilities, interaction design qualities and sharing some interest in quantitative testing. Also, we can explore what is possible with photogrammetry and VR presentations. 

##4 P5 perceptual toolbox & crowdsourcing
What visual information actually reaches your awareness? Or stated differently: what do you see? A simple question that can be answered with a whole battery of psychological tests. Yet, these are not so easy to use, and not specific to the design practice.

In this project we will program a number of these experiments in p5js and will test them on crowdsourcing websites such as Amazon Mechanical Turk. We will try to answer both fundamental aspects of visual communication but the outcome should be a set (toolbox) that can be used in a wide variety of design scenarios.
