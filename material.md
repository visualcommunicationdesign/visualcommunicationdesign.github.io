# Theory

For the theory about perception we will use a reader/book that is currently in draft status. 
* [Here](https://homepage.tudelft.nl/w3s80/VCD/VCD_wijntjes_intro.pdf) you can download the pdf of the introduction (about 10mb) 
* [here](https://homepage.tudelft.nl/w3s80/VCD/VCD_wijntjes_full.pdf) you can download the password projected version (you'll get the password in class).
* Aside from the material we are writing ourselves, there are various interesting books out there. My main recommendation would be [Visual Thinking for Design](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0123708966/ref=rdr_ext_tmb) by Colin Ware, which has been a major inspiration source when teaching this course over the past years. He also wrote the bit more advanced book [Information Visualization - Perception for Design](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0123814642/ref=rdr_ext_tmb) that you should certainly check out when diving deeper in the topic of data visualization. 
* We also highly recommend Ways of Seeing by John Berger, either in [book form](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/014103579X/ref=rdr_ext_tmb) or from his [BBC series](https://youtu.be/0pDE4VX_9Kk).


# Assignment
The assignment consists of 3 parts: analysis, evaluation and creation. You can read everything in the pdf link below. Furthermore, you need to choose 10 works from a total of 30, from every column you need to choose 1.
