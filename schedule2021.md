## Lecture schedule (2020)


Each thursday we will meet online between 13:45-15:30 to discuss and answer questions. Prior to these sesssions you will listen to the lectures, read the book chapter and work on your weekly coding skill progress. The lectures and chapters will be posted on brightspace. The Coding train activities in the *Do* column are there to give some guideline of progress that will let you enjoy Part 3 of the assignment most.

Submitting a DRAFT is *optional*, the reason behind their 'deadline' is that we need them on the Monday before the Thursday lecture (where we discuss them).  If you want to hand in part 3 earlier, you can do hand it in April 1st (to be discussed April 4th, if you feel discussion on April 11 is late).
